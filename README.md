Hi, I'm Vlad-Constantin and I want to thank you for visiting my repo. 

I'm interested in writing code(how clicheic), but seriously, I love doing this. Putting lines of symbols together to obtain solvers, 
parsers, games, simulations excite me the most(that is when it works, but I usually manage to convince the PC to cooperate).

I'm currently learning about artificial intelligence and machine learning at the Politehnica University of Bucharest.
